## About Page Content Mapping

### Hero Section

| Element | Content |
|---------|---------|
| **Title** | "Our Story" |
| **Subtitle** | "Elvenwood Interiors" |

### Story Section

#### The Problem
```
We've all heard the stories.

The carpenter who vanished mid-project. The "premium materials" that turned out
to be something else entirely. The timeline that stretched from weeks to months.
The final bill that looked nothing like the quote.

In Bangalore's interior design industry, broken promises aren't the exception.
They're the norm. And homeowners have learned to expect disappointment.
```

#### Our Solution
```
At Elvenwood, we decided to do things differently.

One designer handles your project from start to finish — no handoffs, no confusion
about who's responsible. Everything is built in our own 12,000 sq ft factory —
no outsourcing, no subcontractors, no mystery about where your cabinets are coming from.

What we promise is what we deliver. The price we quote is the price you pay.
The date we commit to is the date we finish. The 3D render you approve is exactly
what appears in your home.

It sounds simple because it should be.
```

### Elvenwood's Promise (Collective Note)

```
"When we started Elvenwood, the goal was simple: build a company where what we
promise is what we deliver.

Every project goes through our factory, our team, and our oversight. If something
isn't right, we're the ones you call. We don't hide behind subcontractors or blame
suppliers. We take responsibility — because that's what trust means.

We know you've probably been burned before. That's why we invite you to visit our
factory, meet our team, and see exactly how we work. Come skeptical. We'll earn
your confidence."

— Team Elvenwood
```

### Company Values (4)

| Value | Headline | Description |
|-------|----------|-------------|
| **Reliable** | "What we say, we do" | Timelines are commitments, not suggestions. When we say 45 days, your project will be done in 45 days. |
| **Organized** | "One designer, one factory, one system" | No confusion about who's handling what. Your dedicated designer is your single point of contact throughout. |
| **Transparent** | "No hidden costs" | No material substitutions. No surprise charges. You always know exactly what's happening with your project. |
| **Precise** | "What you see is what you get" | Your 3D render isn't an optimistic estimate. It's a commitment. Same materials, same finishes, same everything. |

| **Title** | "Tailored to Your Home" |
| **Subtitle** | "Transparency you can count on" |

### 6 Transparency Promises

#### Promise 1: No Price Surprises
```
The price we quote is the price you pay.

No hidden costs, no material upgrades that mysteriously appear on the final bill,
no "we didn't account for this" additions. We itemize everything upfront, and you
approve before we begin.
```

#### Promise 2: We Actually Respond
```
WhatsApp us. We reply within 4 hours. Every time.

Real phone numbers, real people, real answers. Not a chatbot, not a "someone will
get back to you," not a contact form that goes nowhere. Try it.
```

#### Promise 3: What You See Is What You Get
```
Your 3D render isn't a "best case scenario." It's a commitment.

Same materials, same finishes, same handles, same everything. If something can't
be done exactly as shown, we tell you before you approve — not after.
```

#### Promise 4: The Date We Say, We Mean
```
When we say 45 days, we mean 45 days.

Not "around 45 days" or "45 working days" or "45 days weather permitting."
The actual date. On the calendar. We've never missed a deadline.
```

#### Promise 5: Built for Bangalore Weather
```
BWP plywood, humidity-resistant materials, proper ventilation design.

Your kitchen won't warp in the monsoons. Your wardrobe won't swell in June.
We design for Bangalore's climate, not some generic specification sheet.
```

#### Promise 6: Fair Cancellation Terms
```
Changed your mind? Fair enough.

Clear terms, no guilt trips, no hidden penalties. We want you to proceed because
you're confident, not because you're trapped.
```
